The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the data you're trying to access is not yet available or has been removed. This can happen when you're working with asynchronous operations and try to access data before the promise resolves.  For example, if you try to access the `data()` from a `get()` call before it's completed, you'll get an undefined value leading to unexpected behaviour or crashes.

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then((doc) => {
  console.log(doc.data().myField); // Error if myField is undefined
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error getting document:", error);
});
```
