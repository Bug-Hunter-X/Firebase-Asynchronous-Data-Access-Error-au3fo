This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access data before an asynchronous operation, such as fetching data from a Firestore collection, has completed.  The example code showcases how trying to access undefined fields can cause unexpected crashes or errors.
The solution demonstrates proper error handling and ensuring data availability before accessing fields.
